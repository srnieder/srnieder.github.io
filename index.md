# Dr Simon Nieder

Hello 👋  
You’ve reached a small corner of my online world that is currently being rebuilt at human speed.

I’m an independent researcher with a background in electronic engineering and geophysics, working at the intersection of:

- how humans make meaning,
- how increasingly automated systems reshape that process,
- and how we can design technology that still leaves room for genuine judgment, doubt, and care.

This site will eventually become a gentle hub for a few related threads:

- **Atlas** – my long-running project for mapping lived experience, ethics, and systems thinking.  
- **EpistML** – a small “observatory” for how machine learning changes the conditions of knowing.  
- **Music & churches** – organ playing, choral work, and the quiet spaces that keep me grounded.

For now, think of this page as a holding space rather than a finished statement.

If you’re curious about the ML side of my work, you can visit the early EpistML presence on Hugging Face:

More will arrive here in its own time, at a pace that remains compatible with a human nervous system.

Thanks for visiting, and for your patience while this place finds its new shape.
